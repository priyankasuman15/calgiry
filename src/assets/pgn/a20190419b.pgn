quit popular recently against the Najdorf.} g6 7. g4 h5 {A strange move that
has only been played a handful of times.} ({The main move is} 7... Bg7 8. Bg2

before Black castles.} Ne5 13. O-O-O Nbd7 14. Kb1) 12... O-O {In this opposite
side castling position, White should have an edge because of his space
advantage on the kingside.} 13. Bg2 {A little bit slow, better was} (13. f5 Qa5

get some play. Black should have seeked to finish his development.} (14... Nc6

reasons to be worried.} a4 18. fxg6 axb3 19. gxf7+ Rxf7 20. cxb3 {After both
sides have advanced a pawn and opened up the position, White has a clear
advantage. The b7 bishop has little freedom, and the b8 knight hasn't moved
from its starting square yet.} Qa5 {Black temporarily wins a pawn, but White
will get compensation in the meantime.} 21. Kb1 Bxd5 22. Rhf1 {Trying to open
up the kingside and trade off some of Black's defenders.} Rxf1 23. Rxf1 Bxg2
24. Qxg2 Qa6 {The threat is Qd3.} 25. Rd1 Nd7 $6 {This move doesn't accomplish
much and makes White' task a bit easier. An especially obvious disadvantage is
that it releases control of the key c6 square.} (25... Kh8 {If now} 26. Nf5 {

differences.} Re8 {White can't play Qd5 without having to trade queens on
account of e6.} 27. g6 {threatening Nxd6 followed by Qd5+.} e6 28. Nxd6 {
White will be looking to win.}) 26... Re8 27. Qd5+ Kh8 28. Qf3 $1 $18 {White
is close to winning by this point. I have the threat of Qxh5+ and well placed
pieces, while Black has many hanging pieces.} Ra8 $6 {A last resort that
actually worked, to an extent.} ({The objective best move was} 28... Kg8 29. g6

straightforward way to win is to neutralize Black's attack on the a-file with}

be close to resignation.}) 29... Kg8 {Now Black is still losing, but has a
better chance.} 30. Nxe7+ Kf8 31. Ng6+ Kg8 {Because I was in time trouble, I
decided to repeat moves a few times.} 32. Ne7+ Kf8 33. Ng6+ Kg8 (33... Ke8 {

immediately:} bxa3 35. Ka2 $18) 34. Rd2 Qf1+ 35. Qd1 {This was the position I
saw when I played Qxh5. White is winning, but he must be very careful.} Qf5+ $6

better version of the one that occurred a few moves ago.} Qxh3 $2 {White is
completely winning now.} (37... Qf7 {Black must keep his queen coordinated
with the other Black pieces. However, White can still get a huge advantage.}

move, I failed to find the correct move.} 40. Nf4+ $2 (40. Rxd5 {Black is
helpless, material loss and eventual checkmate is unavoidable.}) ({Even} 40.

The endgame is now only better for White. With best play, however, it is still
winning.} 41. Nxh3 Nf8 $6 (41... Ne5 {is more active and offers Black better
chances.}) 42. Nf4 Be5 43. Nd5 Rb8 44. Rc1 Rb5 45. Ne7 (45. Rc5 {is likely
better than Ne7.} Rxc5 46. Bxc5 Ne6 47. Bxb4 Nxg5 {I am unclear if White can

Black a tempo with the king.} (53. Bf8 {According to the computer, this is the
best move to win the game. I don't fully understand it; I guess it is the only
move that keeps the bishop active but does not give Black the extra tempo. The
computer gives the following line:} Kg4 54. b4 Kf3 55. b5 Bg1 56. b6 e3 57. Bb4
