1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 {I was quite sure this position would appear on the
board as FM Haessel is very principled in his opening choices} Bb4 4. e3 O-O 5.
Bd3 d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Nge2 Re8 8. Bd2 c5 {This commits Black to giving up the
bishop pair not causing any structural damage to White's position} ({Less
committal is} 8... Bd6 {when Black will transpose into a Carlsbad structure
after a further ...c6}) (8... Bf8 {also with a Carlsbad structure in mind}) 9.
a3 Bxc3 (9... cxd4 $2 {was my unfortunate choice in the Calgary International,
underestimating} 10. axb4 dxc3 11. Bxc3 $1 $16 {when White has great dynamic
potential and his unopposed dark squared bishop is very strong. I duly
achieved a lost position but Haessel missed a tactic when low on time which
turned the tables on the game}) 10. Bxc3 ({Haessel's choice in last year's
Over/Under 1800 tournament was} 10. bxc3 b6 11. O-O Ba6 12. Bc2 $6 (12. Bxa6
Nxa6 {is still level}) 12... Nc6 {and Black is already in very good shape in
my opinion, although I did manage to mangle my position later}) 10... c4 11.
Bc2 Bg4 ({The choice of most strong players who have reached this position as
Black is} 11... Nc6) 12. O-O Nc6 13. Qd2 (13. b3 Na5 14. bxc4 Nxc4 {does not
look like anything for White}) 13... Bxe2 $5 {At this point I remembered a
discussion on the merits of the two bishops I had with my good friends
brothers Seguel from Venezuela, now resident in Chile. My point was that IM
Watson in his book Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy pointed out many positions
in which opening the center was actually in the knight pair advantage, so I
tried to prove my point in the position in question} 14. Qxe2 b5 15. f3 {
I had the feeling this move forced White's hand into a do or die break on e4
as otherwise now Black's play in the Queenside will be too strong} a5 16. Rad1
Qb6 {Getting out of the way of the rook on d1, protecting the knight on c6 and
also preparing some tricks} ({Premature is} 16... b4 $6 17. Ba4 $1) 17. Qf2 {
Correctly getting out of the pin} b4 18. Bd2 (18. Be1 $5 {I wondered about
this idea for a while, maybe the bishop can dream of becoming active on g3 or
h4 in a few moves}) ({Another interpretation of the Be1-g3-h4 idea is} 18. axb4
axb4 19. Be1 {when Black has to really go for it in the queenside with} b3 20.
Bb1 Rad8 21. Qd2 Na7 22. Bh4 Nb5 23. Kh1 {which looks very unclear}) 18... Re7
$6 {Unfortunately this way of defending f7 is not very good} ({My intention was
} 18... Rab8 19. Bc1 {and with e4 coming I was not sure how to follow up.
Perhaps} c3 20. bxc3 b3 21. Bb1 b2 22. Bd2 Qb3 23. Qh4 {when} Ne7 $1 {is a key
defensive idea with chances for both sides. This defence is not available with
the rook on e7 as I verified during the game}) 19. Bc1 ({White can already
very much go for it with} 19. g4 Rb8 20. Qh4 h6 21. g5 hxg5 22. Qxg5 {and a
position which I did not like during the game, especially since it comes with
an extra tempo for White. The feeling is that Black is not going anywhere on
the queenside and White will have all the time to deliver checkmate on the
kingside}) 19... Rb8 $2 {Based on a miscalculation} 20. g4 (20. e4 dxe4 21.
fxe4 Ng4 22. Qh4 Nxd4 23. Kh1 Ree8 {correcting the mistake is still not
entirely bad for Black} (23... Nxc2 $4 {was my calculation, omitting that the
rook is hanging on e7 (another reason why Re7 was bad)} 24. Qxe7 $18) 24. Rxd4
Qxd4 25. Qxg4 b3 26. Bb1 c3 $1 {is an interesting computer resource to keep
Black in the game}) 20... c3 $6 {executing my "threat"} (20... Rd8 {is
presumably better but then White can still go} 21. Qh4 $1 {entering the
unpleasant position described before}) 21. bxc3 b3 22. Bb1 b2 23. Bd2 Qb3 {
and so Black has a strong passed pawn and in an ideal world will take next on
a3 and then promote either the b or the a pawn} 24. e4 $2 {also based on a
miscalculation, the Queen on b3 has an "X-ray" defense on the f7 pawn} (24. Qh4
$1 {was even stronger now that the Black Queen can't swing over the sixth rank
for defense}) 24... dxe4 25. g5 (25. fxe4 $6 Nxe4 {is a simple and sufficient
defense, White is going nowhere}) (25. Rde1 {avoiding any ...e3 business seems
best} e3 26. Rxe3 Qxa3 27. Rxe7 Nxe7 28. Re1 Ng6 29. Qg3 {may give White just
enough to compensate for the strong passers}) 25... e3 {a nice defensive idea}
26. Qh4 $2 (26. Bxe3 Nd5 27. Bd2 Nxc3 28. Bxc3 Qxc3 29. Rd3 Qc4 {is grim for
White but had to be tried}) 26... Nh5 $1 {I was very happy to find this move
in my calculations} 27. Bxe3 Rxe3 28. Qxh5 g6 29. Qg4 Qxc3 {after a string of
only moves White is losing} 30. Ba2 {the only idea to make things complicated
during time trouble} Qxa3 {after thinking for a while I found that the
sacrifice on f7 doesn't work and other ideas are refuted simply} 31. Bd5 Ne7 $4
{but now I allow the sacrifice, fortunately Black's advantage is big enough
that even this is not enough to turn the position around} 32. Bxf7+ $1 Kxf7 33.
Qf4+ Kg7 34. Qxb8 Re2 $1 {the only move to keep the advantage, I was happy to
be able to calm down after such a horrible oversight and still find the
winning idea} 35. d5 Qe3+ 36. Kh1 Qxg5 37. Rg1 Qf6 (37... Qf5 {I missed the
strong Qf5-h3 completely paralyzing White} 38. Rgf1 Qh3 39. Qg3 Qxg3 40. hxg3
Nf5 41. Rg1 (41. d6 Nxg3+ 42. Kg1 Nxf1 43. d7 Rd2 44. Rxd2 b1=Q 45. d8=Q Nxd2+
{was one neat winning line}) 41... Nd6 {with a win, the Queenside pawns are
unstoppable}) 38. Rgf1 a4 39. Qb5 $2 (39. Rde1 $3 {is an amazing computer
resource I didn't consider during the game} Rxe1 40. Rxe1 Qxf3+ (40... a3 $1 {
with the idea} 41. Qa7 Qxf3+ 42. Kg1 Kh6 $3 {amazingly wins}) 41. Kg1 {and now
it seems Black has to force the draw}) 39... Qe5 $1 0-1
