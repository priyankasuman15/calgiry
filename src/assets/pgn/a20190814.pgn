structure, d4 and e4 vs c6 and e6, can occur in a number of different openings.
There are different ways to play this, but typically Black aims for either the
...c5 or ...e5 break. But when you do this, you need to weigh the consequences
of White getting a passed pawn on d5. White handled this game beautifully} e5 (

keeps control of d5 and retains an edge. This might not be much, but is a
joyless position to play from the Black side. Gheorghiu understandably reacts
differently, but from now on White's play is exemplary}) 18. Bg3 c5 {[%cal

Nc8-d6 would have me thinking that the position is fine. But Gligoric keeps
hitting Black - for the rest of the game - with almost Capablanca like mini
combos} 19. h4 $1 Nc8 20. hxg5 hxg5 21. Qe3 $1 Nh5 22. d6 $1 {This is the
