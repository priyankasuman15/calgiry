1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. h3 {The Adams Attack,
which is growing in populartity due to all the theory on White's alternative
sixth moves. Fischer won a famous game vs Najdorf back in the early 1960s} (6.
Bg5) (6. Be3) (6. Be2) 6... e5 7. Nb3 ({Carlsen and Anand used to prefer} 7.
Nde2 {but these days the text is more popular}) 7... Be7 8. g4 Be6 9. Bg2 $6 ({

threat of advancing with f5 and gaining control of square d5 is very strong!} (
{The engine prefers} 13. Nxc5) 13... exf4 14. Bxf4 Bg5 $4 {I always go back to
the Shabalov lecture on "Ignoring the Threat" that I attended in Edmonton.
Here White ignores the attack on his bishop and instead replies with a
crushing occupation of the critical central square that his opponent neglected
earlier} 15. Nd5 $1 Qd8 ({Black's best, although still losing, is} 15... Bxd5
16. exd5+ Kd8 17. Bxg5+ hxg5 18. Rxf7 {when Black has exposed his king and
lost material}) 16. Nxc5 $1 Bxf4 ({After} 16... dxc5 17. Nc7+ {also wins
quickly}) 17. Nxe6 {White wins a piece and the game} 1-0
