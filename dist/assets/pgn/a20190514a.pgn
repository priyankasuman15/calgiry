1. d4 e6 2. Bf4 {Ugh! The London
is a perfectly acceptable opening, with for example Gata Kamsky cranking out
win after win against strong opposition. Recently other GMs have found
exciting and aggressive ways to attack with it as well, so absolutely there is
some sting to White's concept. But when a club player trots out the London,
Colle, KIA or the Torre, I secretly wonder how closely related their parents
might be. Oh yeah - I think terrible, terrible things during games!} f5 3. Nf3

the game for a while I expected to be tactically rusty. However, what I did
not appreciate was the degree to which I would struggle coming up with general
plans. I kept floating back and forth between ideas and variations, ending up
with a half baked combination of several ideas. Here I actually thought Black
is doing fine, with my opponent in trouble when ...b4 is played on the
queenside. But before that happens, I felt that a little bit of care was
required to safeguard against White's build-up on the other wing. My spidey
senses were tingling, but should have been roaring!} Ra6 $4 ({Here I had to
play} 21... Qe8 {when the engines comfirm a small edge for White. I thought
what I played was sufficient - defending along the third rank with ...b4
coming next - but I completely missed Jake's excellent reply}) 22. Rxg7 $1 {
I thought to myself there is no way this works, but it very well does! After
this shot Black is objectively lost. So this game actually illustrates two
weaknesses of mine. First there is a tendency to overestimate my king safety,
which is a recurring theme that I will return to in a future article. The sad
part here is not so much missing this tactic, but believing entirely that I
was winning at this moment! But Jake soon shows the killing blow waiting for
me after} ({Even stronger might be} 22. Be5 $18 {when all Black has is sadness.
I saw this idea only after playing my last move. Now depression set in quickly}
) 22... Kxg7 23. Rg1+ Rg6 {For a moment I thought that Black has rebuffed his
opponent's caveman attack, but then, instead of an early lunch, came} 24. Qh6+
$3 {Only now did I appreciate how borked I was, but even plotting Jake's
untimely demise for a few moments did not diminish his excellent execution of
a nice tactical idea! When reviewing books or software dealing with tactics I
always find certain themes that I struggle with more than others. Sneaky
sideways moves like this are the ones I always have trouble with. This little
"kiss from side" is not just a random tactical blow, but an important idea
that can be effectively weaponized in similar attacking schemes. I would much
rather have been exposed to a shot like this in my tactics training than over
the board in a live game. I simply had not come across this idea before in
several decades of tournament play! The effect on me was therefore quite
profound. It's a neat little trick that you are unlikely to intuit OTB unless
you have seen it before} Kf7 25. Qxh7+ Ke8 26. Qxg6+ {Make no mistake, I have
been completely outplayed and White is 100% winning here. Jake deserves full
marks for finding two excellent shots that completely obliterated my entire
defensive setup. Sneaky moves that "look impossible" are a definite blindspot
for me. When a player rated 600 Elo lower ends up essentially sitting on your
chest delivering clean shots to your face - in the way this game transpired
more or less - the effect can leave you contemplating all sorts of life
choices...} Rf7 27. Rg3 b4 28. Bg5 bxc3 29. Bxe7 cxb2+ 30. Kxb2 Kxe7 31. Qb6
