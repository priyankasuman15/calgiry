1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 c6 5. Nf3 h6 6. Bh4 dxc4 7. e4 g5 8. Bg3 b5
9. Be2 Bg7 $2 {A rare and dull move!} 10. e5 Nd5 11. h4 ({I learned after the
game that} 11. a4 {is even stronger}) 11... Qa5 $2 {Aggressive, and suicidal}
12. hxg5 Nxc3 13. Qd2 b4 14. bxc3 bxc3 15. Qc2 $2 {There's no need to believe
in Black's counterplay by blockading the intruding pawn. White only invites
his opponent to land the knight on b4 after} Na6 16. Rc1 Bf8 {A sad-looking
move} 17. Kf1 ({While the side-step with the king is fine, objectively
castling with} 17. O-O {is better since White avoids any and all random
tactical tricks}) 17... Rb8 18. g6 $1 Rb2 19. Qe4 $2 {Far too cautious!} ({
Curiously White does not prefer} 19. gxf7+ {forcing} Kd7 {when Black's
kingside disintegrates without significant counterplay on the queenside}) 19...
Nb4 20. Qf4 $4 {Good grief. Another losing move!} ({Naturally} 20. gxf7+ {
is much better once again}) 20... fxg6 21. Qf6 Rg8 22. Ng5 {The excursion of
the knight does not actually work, but it probably is White's best try} hxg5
23. Rh7 Rg7 24. Rh8 $2 Rf7 25. Qxg6 Rxe2 26. Rh7 Qc7 27. Kxe2 Nd5 28. Rb1 c2
29. Rb8 $4 Nb6 $2 ({Both of us missed the simple} 29... c1=Q 30. Rxc8+ Kd7 $1 {
when Black is easily winning}) 30. Qxe6+ Re7 31. Qg6+ $2 (31. Rxe7+ {wins
without fuss}) 31... Kd8 32. Rh8 Nd7 33. Rxc8+ Qxc8 34. Qxc2 Qa6 35. Kf3 Qa3+
36. Kg4 Qd3 {Here Black offered a draw, for the third time in the game I think,
which I declined on grounds that my opponent seemed scared. Objectively
however, Benjamin should be trying to win here} 37. Qxd3 cxd3 38. Kf3 Ke8 (
38... c5 $142 $138) 39. Ke3 c5 40. Kxd3 cxd4 41. Kxd4 Kf7 42. Rh1 Bg7 43. Re1
Ke6 44. f4 gxf4 45. Bxf4 Kf5 46. Rf1 Kg4 47. Kd5 Nxe5 48. Be3 Ng6 49. Bc5 Rd7+
50. Ke6 Rc7 51. Bd6 Rc6 52. Kd5 Rc2 53. Rf7 {This time I took the draw offer.
But Black should be trying to win} 1/2-1/2
