Ge1c1,Gf1c4,Gg5g6] when O-O-O, Bc4 and g6 are all on deck. Amazing stuff. I
love games like this even though I do not play either side of this line. I am
not especially good at material imbalances or, you know, attacking in general,
so games like this are always instructional}) 11. gxf6 d4 12. Bc4 Qc7 (12...

OTB play. It is only by analyzing games like this that you become familiar
with the attacking themes and ideas and, hopefully, over time resources like
this become second nature. Now} Rf8 (21... Bg6 22. Rxg6 fxg6 23. f7+ Ke7 24.

was 1-0 Van Den Doel-Van Wely, 1999. Poor Loek, who inevitably shows up losing
in an instructive way every time I see a game of his. Maybe one day I will
follow up with a Loek's Greatest Hits collection}) 18. Qxe3 Bxf5 19. Qc5 {
If I am being completely honest, this is another move I would probably miss,
but since the opening is not part of my repetoire I am not going to beat
myself up. The rest, while interesting and complex, diverges from my main
point of tactical blindspots, so I will just give the remainder without comment
