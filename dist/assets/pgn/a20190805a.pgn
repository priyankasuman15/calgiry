cxb2 22. Rab1 Qb5 23. Nxh7 Nd7 {Sitting just a few short feet away from the
two players, while monitoring the live internet transmission of the final
round on the attached notebook computer, the engine evaluations for the
current position suddenly jumped dramatically! Not wanting to spoil the fun I
declined at first viewing any of the suggested lines, hoping to discover the
winning shot myself. But nope, nothing came to mind. Absolutely nothing. In
fact, the harder I tried the more confusing the complications became.} {
Finally Bitan went with} 24. Bc3 {which is a clear error. Both players, not
just your hapless annotator, missed the winning shot!} ({Incredibly, the
improbable and counter intuitive capture} 24. Bxb2 $3 $18 {wins on the spot!} {
After} Nxb2 (24... N3e5 25. Bxe5 Qxb1 26. Rxb1 dxe5 27. Rf1 {is another quite
insane line given by the engines} ({or} 27. Ng5)) 25. Qf4 {the machine
evaluations climb to above +5.00 for White, but with a difficulty level that
likely none but the very top GMs in the world would be able to calculate with
a reasonable level of confidence over the board when we start from the
position after 23...Nd7. Take a look, as utter chaos reigns in lines such as}
Kxh7 ({perhaps the most likely sequence, had Bitan found 24.Bxb2 would be}

31. Rf1 $18 {and Black's defense collapses}) ({don't even ask, according to
the oracle} 25... Nf6 26. Nxf6+ Kxg7 {is no worse for Black than other options
on move 25, although} 27. Nxe8+ (27. Qxd6 {is supposedly best}) 27... Qxe8 28.

non-silicon way to finish}) 26. Qxf7 Rg8 27. Rf4 Qe2 28. Rh4+ Qh5 29. Rxh5+

27. Bxb2 Qe2 28. Qf4 Kg8 29. Qf6 {And in this position, even though he is much
better by now, IM Bryant, needing only a draw to clinch first place, accepts
his opponent's offer to split the point. Indeed, why risk a random accident
with the tournament's outcome on the line} ({The steely nerved engines give}
29. Qf6 Nfd7 {as easily winning for Black}) 1/2-1/2
