Na3 b5 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. c3 O-O ({I am more familar with} 11... Bg5
{which was played against me in the 70s by IM Lawrence Day and IM Bryon
Nickoloff, and 20 years later by GM Dmitri Tyomkin who used to visit his
mother in Toronto. More recently Jim Daniluk of Calgary has played this
against me many times since I came out of retirement in 2015}) 12. Nc2 Rb8 {
This move order has been played by Carlsen a few times in 2019, hence I
suspect it may become popular} 13. h4 g6 14. h5 $6 {My first time playing 13.
h4 in a tournament game meant I was not familiar with the nuances} ({Better to
play} 14. g3 {and wait for} Bg7 {before advancing again with} 15. h5 Ne7 16.
Nce3 Nxd5 17. Nxd5 Be6 18. Bh3 Bxd5 19. Qxd5 b4 20. c4 {as played in
So-Carlsen Norway, 2019 where White was slightly better}) 14... Bg5 {Allowed
by my premature last move} 15. g3 a5 16. a3 Be6 17. Bg2 Ne7 18. Nce3 Kg7 19.
Qd3 Nxd5 20. Nxd5 f5 $5 {Incredibly all my moves were designed to stop the
advance ...f5 since White would be able to open the h/file for the rook and
the h1-a8 diagonal for the bishop in addition to, possibly, the g/file. But my
opponent plays it anyway! Arguably the pawn push is his strategic plan and,
after the game, Praveen said he did not see anything better} 21. Rd1 {[%csl
Yd6] White activates his last piece before opening the position. The latent
threat against the pawn/d6 stops a lot of Black tactics. During the game I
felt Black had over extended, but I failed to notice his 28th move} Qd7 22.
hxg6 hxg6 23. exf5 $6 ({The engines like} 23. f4 {believing Black has to
settle for} Bxd5 ({of course I was much more afraid of} 23... Bh6 24. Qe3 $1 {
[%cal Yh1h6] but then the engine finds} Rh8 25. exf5 gxf5 26. Qf2 Rbd8 27. Rd3
{claiming an advantage for White, but in a position where any human player
will wonder where White's king is to find safe shelter. All in all, only a
computer could dream of opening the position with the king still in the center,
only to displace the opponent's dark squared bishop!}) 24. fxg5 Bxe4 25. Bxe4
fxe4 26. Qxd6 {with a better ending for White}) 23... Bxf5 24. Be4 Qa7 25. O-O
$2 {Castling prematurely on move 25!} ({I had to eliminate the bishop with} 25.
Bxf5) 25... Bh3 ({Much more awkward for White, here or again in another couple
of moves, is} 25... Bg4 26. Rde1 Bh3 27. Bg2 {when Black, who is already
better, can play} Rh8 {without worry about his d/pawn after the retreat} 28.
Ne3) 26. Bg2 Bf5 27. Be4 Be6 28. Ne3 Rxf2 $5 {This came like a bolt from the
blue. I managed to keep my poker face and hoped that it did not force
immediate resignation} 29. Kxf2 Bc4 30. Qd2 Rf8+ 31. Kg2 Bxf1+ 32. Rxf1 Rxf1
33. Kxf1 Qxe3 ({Luckily after} 33... Bxe3 34. Qxd6 {[%csl Yg6] White has
counterplay against pawn/g6}) 34. Qxe3 Bxe3 35. Ke2 $1 {Most precise. White's
central blockade would make for an easy draw} Bc1 36. b4 Bxa3 37. bxa5 Bc5 38.
a6 Kf6 39. Bd3 Kg5 40. Kf3 d5 41. Bxb5 e4+ 42. Kg2 Kf5 43. Bc6 Ke5 44. Kf1 d4
45. cxd4+ Kxd4 46. Ke2 g5 47. g4 Ke5 48. Bd7 Kf4 49. Bf5 Ba7 {Finally Black
gave in and offered a draw. A memorable fight, and lucky for me the combo 28...
Rxf2 did not win on the spot. The engine agrees the sacrifice was Black's best
try, and it is a good example for Bareev's chapter on "Play Without Castling"
in his excellent book "Say No To Chess Principles"} 1/2-1/2
